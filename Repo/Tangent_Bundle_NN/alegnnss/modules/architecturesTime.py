architecturesTime.py Architectures module

Definition of GNN architectures. The basic idea of these architectures is that
the data comes in the form {(S_t, x_t)} where the shift operator as well as the
signal change with time, and where each training point consists of a trajectory.
Unlike architectures.py where the shift operator S is fixed (although it can
be changed after the architectures has been initialized) and the training set
consist of a set of {x_b} with b=1,...,B for a total of B samples, here the
training set is assumed to be a trajectory, and to include a different shift
operator for each sample {(S_t, x_t)_{t=1}^{T}}_{b=1,...,B}. Also, all 
implementations consider a unit delay exchange (i.e. the S_t and x_t values
get delayed by one unit of time for each neighboring exchange).

    LocalGNN_DB: implement the local GNN architecture where all operations are
        implemented locally, i.e. by means of neighboring exchanges only. More
        specifically, it has graph convolutional layers, but the readout layer,
        instead of being an MLP for the entire graph signal, it is a linear
        combination of the features at each node. It considers signals
        that change in time with batch GSOs.

    Initialization:

        LocalGNN_DB(dimNodeSignals, nFilterTaps, bias, # Graph Filtering
                    nonlinearity, # Nonlinearity
                    dimReadout, # Local readout layer
                    dimEdgeFeatures) # Structure

        Input:
            /** Graph convolutional layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nFilterTaps (list of int): number of filter taps on each layer
                (i.e. nFilterTaps-1 is the extent of neighborhoods that are
                 reached, for example K=2 is info from the 1-hop neighbors)
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nFilterTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nFilterTaps) = L.
                
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Readout layers **/
            dimReadout (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers applied locally at each node
                (i.e. no exchange of information involved).
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            dimEdgeFeatures (int): number of edge features

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Local GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics that considers time-varying batch GSO and delayed
            signals

    Forward call:

        LocalGNN_DB(x, S)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimFeatures x numberNodes
            GSO (torch.tensor): graph shift operator; shape
                batchSize x timeSamples (x dimEdgeFeatures)
                                                    x numberNodes x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the GNN; 
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes
                
    Other methods:
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x, S): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which has shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes,
        as well as the output of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the readout
        layers), yGNN of shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimFeatures[-1]
        x numberNodes. This can be used to isolate the effect of the graph
        convolutions from the effect of the readout layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, S, nodes): outputs the value of the last
        layer at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimFeatures x numberNodes. nodes is either a single
        node (int) or a collection of nodes (list or numpy.array) of length
        batchSize, where for each element in the batch, we get the output at
        the single specified node. The output y is of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1].
